## Etiquette Regarding Communication
When requesting support, try to remember that we are all volunteers that have lives outside of this project and none of us are paid to ensure things work for you, so please be considerate of others' time when you are asking for things. Many of us have families/friends/work/university that also need time as well and only have so much time to give on a daily basis. We will do what we can to provide support when folks are running into issues, but you may have to wait, so a little consideration and patience will be welcome. After all, you are using a pretty good tool without cost. It may not be perfect (yet), and we know that.

## Defining a contribution
You are a contributor if you...
* have maded a pull request which was accepted
* are/were a [member](https://github.com/orgs/CC-Hive/people) of the github organisation


# General
* Follow styling sheet (to be made)
* Comment your code in a way that LDoc can use (see below)
* Try to keep commits descriptive (I will admit that I don't always do this)
* Do lots of small commits over one big one, it's easier for others to contribute with you and easier to revert parts
* Pull requests: if it's all related then it can all go together, just make sure it's not all one big commit (see above) I can revert parts I don't like later. As to deciding what's related, use your best judgment.
* Don't edit files which your team is not responsible for, If you are not sure then check [here](https://github.com/orgs/CC-Hive/teams) the team description will help you. if you are still confused then just ask, either on the forums or make an issue.
