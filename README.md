## Etiquette Regarding Communication
When requesting support, try to remember that we are all volunteers that have lives outside of this project and none of us are paid to ensure things work for you, so please be considerate of others' time when you are asking for things. Many of us have families/friends/work/university that also need time as well and only have so much time to give on a daily basis. We will do what we can to provide support when folks are running into issues, but you may have to wait, so a little consideration and patience will be welcome. After all, you are using a pretty good tool without cost. It may not be perfect (yet), and we know that.

## differences from original:
* not use CCDocker - definitly maybe
* use Howl - almost required for multi repo
* better seperation, intention of seperate exicutables (with a combined option)
* LDoc documentation Generation
* 

## to do
* [ ] link back to other project repos, or skip to sub-moduleing them

## hopes
* turtles share pathfindong map data, data is stored on server and turtles pull copies of the map as needed and update the map if the world changes
* 

# Contributing Guide
* follow styling sheet (to be made)
* comment your code in a way that LDoc can use (see below)
* try to keep commits descriptive (I will admit that I don't always do this)
* do lots of small commits over one big one, it's easier for others to contribute with you and easier to revert parts
