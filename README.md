Made an edit which doesn't change code? put `[ci skip]` into your commit description Howl-CI and Travis will skip the build. Save energy, don't rebuild when not needed.

Hive will require ComputerCraft(CC) 1.6 or later, this is due to rednet protocals. However, it is looking likely that the minimum version will be CC 1.64, for turtle.getItemDetail/inspect. If anyone want to port Hive to an older CC then best of luck to you.

## Etiquette Regarding Communication
When requesting support, try to remember that we are all volunteers that have lives outside of this project and none of us are paid to ensure things work for you, so please be considerate of others' time when you are asking for things. Many of us have families/friends/work/university that also need time as well and only have so much time to give on a daily basis. We will do what we can to provide support when folks are running into issues, but you may have to wait, so a little consideration and patience will be welcome. After all, you are using a pretty good tool without cost. It may not be perfect (yet), and we know that.

## What's in a name?
Given the hoped for end result of Hive, one will have a MC base as busy as a beehive due to the multitude of turtles working under the direction of a server. Or as one [forum user](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/22421-wip-mit-hive-a-turtle-control-system/page__view__findpost__p__213763) put it "as if the Turtles have a singular 'Hive' mind."

Alternatively, because every good opensource project seems to have a recursive acronym - "Hive Is Very... acronyms are hard".
