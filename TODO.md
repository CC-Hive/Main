## Things to do
The other repositories will have their own to do lists, you may want to check those too
*     Clean up to do lists from time to time (move compleated items to bottom)
* [ ] Howl prepends all resulting lua files with [license](https://github.com/CC-Hive/Main/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), preferably as a sting/table of strings so that it can be printed to the screen if a user requests an about page
* [ ] https://help.github.com/articles/helping-people-contribute-to-your-project/
* [ ] Expand with new things to do
* [ ] Create TODO.md for other repositories
* [ ] clean up md files
* [ ] https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/COMMITTERS.md
* [ ] https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
* [ ] add to contributing
 * Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
 * Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
 * Community and behavioral expectations.
* [ ] other special files: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README
* [ ] link map in readme, to aid navigation of visitors
* [ ] low priority: decide distribution method, github mile stones?
* [x] Add links here to other repos
* [x] Link back to other project repos, or skip to sub-moduleing them
* [x] Port old to do from README
* [x] ~~Rename hopes to wishes~~ renamed to extended goals

## Extended Goals
#### Don't work on these until the above are done
* [ ] Hive walks the user through the first time setup
* [ ] Turtles share pathfinding map data, data is stored on server and turtles pull copies of the map as needed and update the map if the world changes
* [ ] Multi language support, perhaps via a table
* [ ] First time setup guidence, the different programs give instuctions to the user on required peripherals, how to connect a turtle, etc.
* [ ] Addon or plugin support, third-party code which can change the behavour of Hive in ways which a task can't (override how the server does things)
