## Extended Goals
#### Don't work on these untill the above are done
* [ ] Turtles share pathfinding map data, data is stored on server and turtles pull copies of the map as needed and update the map if the world changes
* [ ] Multi language support, perhaps via a table
* [ ] First time setup guidence, the different programs give instuctions to the user on required peripherals, how to connect a turtle, etc.
* [ ] Addon or plugin support, third-party code which can change the behavour of Hive in ways which a task can't (override how the server does things)
