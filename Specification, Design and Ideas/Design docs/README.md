In this folder are all the specific design doc for what each component needs to be able to do.

There are 5 maps: Turtle, Server, Dock system, specifications and Examples&Information :
* In Turtle and Server folder you will see the information of what the program needs to do
* In the Dock system folder is all the information regarding refueling and inventory
* In the Specifications folder are all the specifications for the above
* In the Examples&Information folder there is more general information about the project


Each design file (turtle and Server) will have a General tab for the general information. 
And a required component which will be a list with all the thing's the program will need to be able to do.

Each component also has a idea's section where you can put any ideas you have, so feel free to add something.
Some component may also have a rejected idea's section so first look to that if you are planning to implement something.


Want to start coding? Look in the required components list where al the things are listed the computer/turtle should be able to do.
Want any inspiration or information and library's look in the links.md were you will find anything you like, or you could just google it.
