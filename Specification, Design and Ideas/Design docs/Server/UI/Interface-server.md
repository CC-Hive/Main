The server computer will consist of two parts the interface which the user can interact with, and the server that will manage the turtles.
This will probably be one computer but it could be two.
For more detailed information see Server-Info, best to also see Task-Info to know what a task contains.


## General:
The interface will consist of differt tabs.
The are standard task we will have like mining and farming, and the user can also add custom made tasks(see tasks file).
I think it will be handy if most clicks while lead in to a pop-up with some other buttons to choose from.

## Required components:
* The first tab will have a list of al the turtles and all there information (see turtle-status for more specifics).
The user will be able to click on a turtle so he can give him a task.
* The second tab will be a tasks manager we are the user can add new or delete old tasks.
* The third tab will be the settings tab were you can change your settings(these are yet to be made)



## Ideas List:
* Pocket computer variant
* Monitor capability
