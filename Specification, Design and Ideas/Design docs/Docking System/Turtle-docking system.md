The dock will consist of multiple bays which will have probably two chest one for dumping inventory the other for getting resources (e.g. fuel).

* Turtles ask for a bay and queue until one is available
* A dedicated server manages which bays are in use, and may also be responseable for piping resorces to the docking bays
