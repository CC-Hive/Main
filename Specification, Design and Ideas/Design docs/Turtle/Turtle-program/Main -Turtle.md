The program for the turtle will be split up in two sections, the movement part and the main program.
Look in Turtle-Info for more specific's, best to also see Task-Info to know what a task contains.

## General:
The user will have to ran a simple program, with the name of his hive as paramater.
Then it autolabel it self, and the turtle will register with the server.
It then waits for a task for the server to execute and repeats.
Most of the thinking will be done by the server, the turtle will only execute his tasks.

## Required componenents:
* Starting program which will download all the order file's the turtle needs, autolabel it's self program is already written,
and then it will ask for the Hive's name and registers
* The second program which will be in the startup will carry with his task if he has one and can, otherwise the turtle will send an update of his status and waits for a new task to carry out.
