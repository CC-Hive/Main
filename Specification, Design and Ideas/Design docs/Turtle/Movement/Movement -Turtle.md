The program for the turtle will be split up in two sections, the movement part and the main program.

## General:
The movement section will consist of two parts, a tracking api(something like LAMA) and a pathfinding program.

## Required componenents:
* a tracking api like LAMA that will keep track of the position and facing. 
It will also replace all moving commands like turtle.forward(). No other program should use turtle.forward or others.
* The pathfinding program main function is Goto() where a location of a docking bay or the start of a task will be taken and the program will lead the turtle to it.
* The Turtle's may build a map of the world (using skyNav for this)


## Ideas List:
* for pathfinding: highways for the turtles
* mapping program what will map the area, for more information: (http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/9717-octree-efficient-way-of-storing-and-querying-3d-data/ )
