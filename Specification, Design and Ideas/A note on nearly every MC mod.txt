Due to Hive being designed for ComputerCraft (CC) and everyone's mod set-up being different, Hive should be independent of any peripheral that is not included in vanilla CC.

If developers wish to add extra functionality which will require any mod other than CC then please make such features last (so core functionality of Hive can be achieved). Additionally, please make such features optional and non-essential to Hive.
