* adding drones
* adding tasks
* sending tasks to drones
* sending drone status to nest
* turtle refuel system --not sure how best to do this, had an idea though
* persistence --this will be limited by third party programs in tasks, guess I'll throw an error
* track drone status and location
* auto scheduled recurring tasks (useful for farm maintenance)
* automatically attempt to recover some errors (turtle out of fuel, send more fuel/turtle location file is corrupt, +-+send another to last known and home in on modem messages, position 3.0)
* turtle build a map of the world (using skyNav for this)
* erroring drones send their error info to nest
* drones return to nest after a tasks
* if the nest doesn't receive a drone status update within a time limit, mark that drone as MIA
